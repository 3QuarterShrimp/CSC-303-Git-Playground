Plans for upcoming DND campain I'm going to DM

Normal world exept all of the world's oceans are replaced by a giant forest.  
The trees reach up to about sea level would on a normal world with a few trees spread throughout the
world being much larger (think of the spirit tree in the swamp in the avatar cartoon).  These yggdrasil trees
are the only consistent oppenings to the forest below.  The branches of the regular trees are unnaturally
durable and resiliant to damage and will heal almost instantaneously when damaged and any pieces broken
off desolve into dust and disappear.  The reason people would want to go down into the depths is because
of the various resources you can find in them.  The main resources are monster materials and mana.
Some of the trees deeper down produce sap that crystalizes into a amber that can store mana and can
be used as a fuel source for magical items.
