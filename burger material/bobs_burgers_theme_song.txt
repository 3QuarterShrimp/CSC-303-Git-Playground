Banjo
Banjo
Doesn't play it for fun
He's just hiding his gun

Banjo
Banjo
His chaps made of leather
Even in hot weather

Banjo
(He's comin', gunnin' for ya)
Banjo
(He's comin', strummin' for ya)
You can try to talk
But he don't give a pluck

Banjo
(He's comin', gunnin' for ya)
Banjo
(He's comin', strummin' for ya)
He's strumming for you
